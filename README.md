# UNIFAC_Method
UNIFAC Method implemented in Python to calculate activity coefficient and Pxy diagram for a non-ideal binary mixture.

This work includes:
- **Interaction_Parameters.csv file** containing the UNIFAC principal group interaction parameters from Table H.2 of Smith et al. (2004).
- **Ksubgroup_Parameters.csv file** containing the UNIFAC subgroup parameters from Table H.1 of Smith et al. (2004).
- **FuncionesUNIFAC.py** containg the main calculations of the UNIFAC Method.
- **main.py** as the main program with the components of the binary mixture as input and the Pxy diagram as the final outcome.

Here is a little tutorial (It's in Spanish tho!): https://youtu.be/hUNDTKfeCVw
